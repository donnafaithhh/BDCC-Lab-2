# Binance-For-Beginners

The works in this repository were created by Donna Faith Go and Raymond Castro for our Big Data and Cloud Computing class. 
Here, we applied what we know about big data on the Binance Full History dataset where we took the perspective of first-time investors, new to trading cryptocurrency.
To see our work, open `final report.html`.
