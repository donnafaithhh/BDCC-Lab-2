    "**Understanding Cryptocurrency**\n",
    "\n",
    "In recent years, trading in cryptocurrency has started to gain traction among many traders. \n",
    "However, the field, in itself, could be obscure especially for new traders trying to learn more about it and trying to penetrate the trading market. \n",
    "Before we discuss more about trading in cryptocurrency, let us discuss first what cryptocurrency is. \n",
    "There are a lot of things that we can say about cryptocurrency, but we will only be talking about the basic things that beginner traders need to know. \n",
    "\n",
    "Cryptocurrency is a type of digital money that is not issued or governed by any central authority like a government or bank. \n",
    "Usually, they are considered an alternative asset and investment where many people buy them to hold in hopes of the value appreciating over time (CryptoCrafted, 2025).\n",
    "When trading, everyone has to deal with a trading pair which consists of two currencies: base currency and quote currency. \n",
    "The base currency represents the asset  being bought or sold.\n",
    "The quote currency is used to express the value or price of one unit of the base currency.\n",
    "For example, in a BTC-USDT pair, Bitcoin (BTC) is the base currency and Tether (USDT) is the quote currency, meaning the price shows how many USDT are needed to buy one BTC. \n",
    "Understanding which currency is the base and which is the quote is essential for traders to accurately interpret prices, calculate profits and losses, and manage risk (Bitcoin.com, 2025, MK Manoylov, 2024). \n",
    "\n",
    "To further expound, quote currencies are classified into three main categories: fiat-backed stablecoins, crypto-collaterized stablecoins, and non-stable quote currencies (Kraken Learn team, 2024). \n",
    "Fiat-backed stablecoins are pegged to traditional government-issued currencies like the US dollar or the Euro. \n",
    "This is so maintain price stability. \n",
    "Crypto-collateralized stablecoins are backed by other cryptocurrencies held in reserve to provide security and liquidity. \n",
    "Non-stable quote currencies are the ones with the most volatile price behavior. \n",
    "Good traders know which ones to choose to match their risk appetite, stability needs, and trading strategies within the crypto market. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Understanding Binance**\n",
    "\n",
    "For traders to participate in trading cryptocurrency, usually they have to go through a platform in order to buy, sell, and trade Bitcoin, Ethereum, and other altcoins. \n",
    "One of the known and popular platforms is Binance. \n",
    "According to BSO Editorial (2023), Binance is one of the largest cryptocurrency exchanges in the world.\n",
    "They offer the trading services for a wide range of digital assets and 530 crypto-to-crypto trading pairs alongside futures contracts for various cryptocurrencies."

    "2. **Exploratory Data Analysis**: Here, we prepared and cleaned the dataset to ensure that it is suitable for further analysis. EDA is used to understand the behavior of the closing price for different classifications: base currencies, quote currencies, and even their classifications. These would be further discussed later on.\n",
    "3. **Data Processing**: In this step, we want to get answers for our research problem which is to find out the volatility, price stability, and trading activity patterns among the three classifications: cryptocurrency, fiat-based tokens, and stablecoin.\n",
    "4. **Results and Discussion**: Based on what we find, we want to discuss what this could mean for investors, mention our perceived benefits and disadvantages, and recommend further steps. Afterwards, we will summarize findings in the recommendations and conclusion section.\n",

    "1. The market of the base coin has not matured enough yet. This is evident when the correlation plots of the base coins in earlier years are observed. Lesser users engaging with the specific coin means lesser data for correlation value, therefore the values in consideration are more sensitive to randomness. \n",
    "2. Difference in macroeconomic conditions. More specifically, the value of EUR is tied to the real world currency of Europe, the Euro. This means that the value of any cryptocurrency tied to EUR could transitively be affected by changes in the Euro, which could cause the return behavior to deivate from those tied to US currencies (USDT and BUSD).\n",

    "**Business Implications of Our Report**\n",
    "\n",
    "From a beginner trader's perspective, our study can serve as a data-driven guide for knowing how to navigate trading on the Binance platform.\n",
    "We clearly gave the differences on both the quote and base currency and how these can affect trading strategies. \n",
    "At the end, we were able to suggest a general framework for a trading strategy for the base-quote pairs we inspected in Binance.\n",
    "Although it is not a full trading strategy yet, it can be a guide for future work or for future traders.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Limitations of the Study**\n",
    "\n",
    "Due to time constraints, we were not able to apply more advanced analyses on the different base and quote currency pairs.\n",
    "Furthermore, we are clearly not as experienced in Binance as the average trader, so we were learning more about the platform along the way.\n",
    "There was a great learning curve that we had to address just to understand the terms that we discussed in this report.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Recommendations for Future Works**\n",
    "  \n",
    "For future work, we'd recommend that people do topological data analysis (TDA) on the relationships between the different base and quote currency pairs.\n",
    "There is abundant data, and there are also a lot of currencies to choose from, so doing TDA would be a great way to visualize the latent relationships between the trading options available on binance. \n",
    "Furthermore, looking at the relationship between different base currencies with only available quote currency would be interesting to find out. \n",
    "Lastly, if we had more time, it would have been interesting to generate portfolios or a trading strategy at least for the different base-quote cryptocurrency pairs.\n",
    "This would have shown a great application of our learnings."
