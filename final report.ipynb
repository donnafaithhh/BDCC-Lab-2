    "\n",
    "In recent years, trading in cryptocurrency has started to gain traction among many traders. \n",
    "However, the field, in itself, could be obscure especially for new traders trying to learn more about it and trying to penetrate the trading market. \n",
    "Before we discuss more about trading in cryptocurrency, let us discuss first what cryptocurrency is. \n",
    "There are a lot of things that we can say about cryptocurrency, but we will only be talking about the basic things that beginner traders need to know. \n",
    "\n",
    "Cryptocurrency is a type of digital money that is not issued or governed by any central authority like a government or bank. \n",
    "Usually, they are considered an alternative asset and investment where many people buy them to hold in hopes of the value appreciating over time (CryptoCrafted, 2025).\n",
    "When trading, everyone has to deal with a trading pair which consists of two currencies: base currency and quote currency. \n",
    "The base currency represents the asset  being bought or sold.\n",
    "The quote currency is used to express the value or price of one unit of the base currency.\n",
    "For example, in a BTC-USDT pair, Bitcoin (BTC) is the base currency and Tether (USDT) is the quote currency, meaning the price shows how many USDT are needed to buy one BTC. \n",
    "Understanding which currency is the base and which is the quote is essential for traders to accurately interpret prices, calculate profits and losses, and manage risk (Bitcoin.com, 2025, MK Manoylov, 2024). \n",
    "\n",
    "To further expound, quote currencies are classified into three main categories: fiat-backed stablecoins, crypto-collaterized stablecoins, and non-stable quote currencies (Kraken Learn team, 2024). \n",
    "Fiat-backed stablecoins are pegged to traditional government-issued currencies like the US dollar or the Euro. \n",
    "This is so maintain price stability. \n",
    "Crypto-collateralized stablecoins are backed by other cryptocurrencies held in reserve to provide security and liquidity. \n",
    "Non-stable quote currencies are the ones with the most volatile price behavior. \n",
    "Good traders know which ones to choose to match their risk appetite, stability needs, and trading strategies within the crypto market. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Understanding Binance**\n",
    "\n",
    "For traders to participate in trading cryptocurrency, usually they have to go through a platform in order to buy, sell, and trade Bitcoin, Ethereum, and other altcoins. \n",
    "One of the known and popular platforms is Binance. \n",
    "According to BSO Editorial (2023), Binance is one of the largest cryptocurrency exchanges in the world.\n",
    "They offer the trading services for a wide range of digital assets and 530 crypto-to-crypto trading pairs alongside futures contracts for various cryptocurrencies."

    "Below would be a short summary of each of the different steps:\n",
    "1. **Data Collection**: Here, we collect publicly available historical Binance data focusing on the closing price. Since the dataset is very big, we stored it in a Spark DataFrame.\n",
    "2. **Exploratory Data Analysis**: Here, we prepared and cleaned the dataset to ensure that it is suitable for further analysis. EDA is used to understand the behavior of the closing price for different classifications: base currencies, quote currencies, and even their classifications. We filtered out base currencies with fewer than eight quote currencies to ensure meaningful comparisons. Correlation analyses were conducted to examine relationships between base currency returns across different quote currencies and among base currencies within the same quote currency. \n",
    "3. **Data Processing**: In this step, we want to get answers for our research problem which is to find out the volatility, price stability, and trading activity patterns among the three classifications: cryptocurrency, fiat-based tokens, and stablecoin. Annual volatility was computed using the standard deviation of daily log returns, scaled by the square root of 365, to identify fluctuations and trends. We also explored the relationship between trading volume and returns to detect patterns in market participation and trading behavior for different base currencies.\n",
    "4. **Results and Discussion**: Based on what we find, we want to discuss what this could mean for investors, mention our perceived benefits and disadvantages, and recommend further steps. Afterwards, we will summarize findings in the recommendations and conclusion section.\n",

    "A more specific and detailed description of the different steps and diagrams would be provided in their respective sections."

    "In connection with the previous column chart analysis, some cells within the correlation plots of years 2017, 2018, and 2019 are left empty because the expansion of Binance assets did not occur until 2019. \n",
    "Given that all of the correlation cells are closer to the value of 1.00 (colored by a shade of green), the value of the base coin's return gives a small difference when there is a change in the quote currency. \n",
    "This is clearly shown in the correlation plots of BTC and ETH in years 2021 and 2022 wherein all the correlation values lie within the range of 0.95 to 1.00. \n",
    "For ADA, some explanations for its relatively lower correlations could be that:\n",
    "1. The market of the base coin has not matured enough yet. This is evident when the correlation plots of the base coins in earlier years are observed. Lesser users engaging with the specific coin means lesser data for correlation value, therefore the values in consideration are more sensitive to randomness. \n",
    "2. Difference in macroeconomic conditions. More specifically, the value of EUR is tied to the real world currency of Europe, the *Euro*. This means that the value of any cryptocurrency tied to EUR could transitively be affected by changes in the Euro, which could cause the return behavior to deivate from those tied to US currencies (USDT and BUSD).\n",
    "\n",
    "Given that most of the correlation plots show similar results, the return values of the base currency do not have a strong dependency on the quote currency. Differing quote currencies usually have the same behavior when under the same base currency."

    "In comparison to Figure 4, the correlation plots in Figure 5 describe how the base currencies move relative to each other when paired with the same quote currency. \n",
    "First, it could be noticed that there is a slow increase in the correlations of all the base currencies as the years pass. \n",
    "As these cryptocurrency markets mature, the behavior of the base currencies becomes more similar as they gain more user activity (liquidity).\n",
    "Looking closer into the plots, it could be noticed that across all quote currencies, the correlation between BTC and ETH is stronger than that of BTC and ADA. \n",
    "What this hints is that the movement of ADA deviates somewhat by differing/broader market factors, but the overall movement of these three base currencies is the same nonetheless. "

    "To summarize our report, we can say that data-drive trading in Binance has now been made easier from our findings.\n",
    "Major base currencies such as BTC and ETH demonstrate high return correlations across different quote currencies (USDT, BUSD, EUR), indicating that their performance is largely independent of the quote currency chosen. This suggests that first-time traders focusing on these established assets do not need to be overly concerned about which quote currency to select, as returns are generally consistent.\n",
    "\n",
    "In contrast, less established base currencies, like ADA, show lower correlations, especially in the earlier years of trading.\n",
    "This reflects lower liquidity, greater sensitivity to macroeconomic factors (e.g., fluctuations in the Euro), and higher exposure to market-specific dynamics. \n",
    "Volatility analysis further reveals that some cryptocurrencies maintain stable annual volatility, while others experience pronounced spikes due to market events or adoption cycles. \n",
    "Newly introduced quote currencies generally exhibit lower initial volatility, indicating gradual integration into trading activity. \n",
    "Moreover, trading volume does not consistently predict returns, as observed with LTC, which demonstrates low daily volumes but variable returns, reflecting unique market microstructure characteristics.\n",
    "\n",
    "Figure 8 reinforces the importance of liquidity, showing that USDT-quoted pairs consistently maintain the highest average trading volumes, while EUR pairs form a middle tier and BUSD pairs typically show the lowest volumes. \n",
    "This demonstrates how the choice of quote currency can influence trading efficiency and market participation.\n",
    "    \n",
    "Overall, for a first-time investor, this implies that **established cryptocurrencies paired with stable quote currencies offer relatively predictable risk and price behavior, whereas newer or less liquid assets carry higher uncertainty**. \n",
    "Understanding these differences would allow an investor to better align their portfolio with their risk tolerance, particularly in the choice of base and quote currency pairs."

    "The last date in our dataset is in the year 2022, which is three years ago.\n",
    "Updated data is crucial for more accurate predictions and analyses on the behavior of the base and quote currency pairs on Binance.\n",
    "For future work, we'd recommend that people do topological data analysis (TDA) on the relationships between the different base and quote currency pairs.\n",
    "There is abundant data, and there are also a lot of currencies to choose from, so doing TDA would be a great way to visualize the latent relationships between the trading options available on binance. \n",
    "Furthermore, looking at the relationship between different base currencies with only available quote currency would be interesting to find out. \n",
    "Lastly, if we had more time, it would have been interesting to generate portfolios or a trading strategy at least for the different base-quote cryptocurrency pairs.\n",
